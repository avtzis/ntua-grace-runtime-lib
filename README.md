# Grace Runtime Library

Welcome to the **Grace Runtime Library** repository! This repository contains the source code and documentation for the compiler library developed as part of the compilers course project at ECE-NTUA. The library is made to get a grade. It is **NOT** explicitly designed to support the compilation of programs written in the Grace programming language.

## About Grace Language

Grace is a language designed specifically to make it easier for new programmers to learn to program. Itâ€™s small, concise, and amazingly powerful. Grace leaves out a lot of the boilerplate that lards other languages; this makes it easier for new students to focus on the essentials of programming. The primary goal of this project is to get a grade, **NOT** to develop a reliable and efficient compiler for the Grace language.

## Features

- Written using C and its standard system libraries.
- Simple as is. No particular optimizations or advanced techniques used.
- Compatible with probably anything not Windows related.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/avtzis/ntua-grace-runtime-lib.git && cd ntua-grace-runtime-lib/
  ```
2. Build:
  ```bash
  make
  ```
3. Move library to your compiler directory:
  ```bash
  mv libgrc.a path/to/compilerdir
  ```

### Usage

Link with `clang`:
  ```bash
  clang program.s libgrc.a
  ```

### Example

```bash
./grc < program.grc > temp.ll
llc -o temp.s temp.ll
clang -o a.out temp.s libgrc.a -no-pie
rm temp.s temp.ll
```

- `readString(i64, ptr) -> void`
- `ascii(i8) -> i32`
- `chr(i64) -> i8`
- `strlen(ptr) -> int`
